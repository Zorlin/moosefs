# MooseFS High Availability and Metadata Sharding Enhancement

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement a complete, self-contained design for adding true high-availability (HA) and optional metadata sharding to MooseFS Community Edition (MFS-CE). The enhancement focuses exclusively on the metadata tier while keeping the existing chunkserver layer untouched.

## Goals and Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
- **G1**: Achieve zero-RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and sub-second RTO (Recovery Time Objective) for metadata loss to be competitive with enterprise filesystems
- **G2**: Enable horizontal scaling of metadata IOPS through sharding to eliminate the current "single master" bottleneck
- **G3**: Survive WAN partitions and datacenter loss while maintaining availability for both reads and writes, targeting multi-region deployments
- **G4**: Maintain small operational footprint (< 5 binaries) with obvious codepaths for community maintainability

### Non-Goals
- **NG1**: No changes to chunk placement or erasure-coding logic (out-of-scope)
- **NG2**: No POSIX-breaking semantics - applications cannot observe divergence

## High-Level Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Metadata Server (MDS)** - Enhanced metadata servers with Raft consensus
2. **Shard Management** - Distributed metadata sharding with consistent hashing
3. **CRDT State Management** - Conflict-free replicated data types for eventual consistency
4. **Circular Replication Ring** - Efficient delta propagation between nodes
5. **Gossip Protocol** - Lightweight membership and topology management

### Key Technical Innovations
- **Raft Leader Lock Pattern**: Fast, strongly consistent leadership per-shard
- **CRDT-based Metadata**: Allows multi-writer behavior across partitions
- **Circular Delta Streaming**: Logarithmic spread with k-successor widening
- **Optimistic Writes**: Sub-millisecond write acknowledgment with eventual consistency

## Detailed Feature Requirements

### 1. Raft Consensus Implementation
- Embed existing Raft library (etcd-raft or Hashicorp Raft)
- Implement leader election with sub-second failover
- Support 3-5 node replica groups per shard
- Handle network partitions gracefully

### 2. CRDT Data Model
- **Inode Attributes**: Last-Writer-Wins registers with Lamport timestamps
- **Link Counts**: Grow-Only counters with element-wise addition
- **Directory Entries**: Observed-Remove Sets for file operations
- **Extended Attributes**: LWW registers for metadata
- **Quota Usage**: PN-Counters for space accounting

### 3. Sharding Strategy
- Use Blake3 hash function for consistent shard assignment
- Support dynamic shard rebalancing
- Implement shard table in embedded database (BadgerDB or LMDB)
- Handle cross-shard operations (rename) with two-phase commit

### 4. Circular Replication
- Implement topology-aware successor selection
- Delta propagation with O(N·k) message complexity
- Duplicate detection using entry UUID hashes
- Configurable fan-out width (default: ⌈log₂(N)⌉)

### 5. Client Integration
- **Fast Reads**: Direct CRDT store access from any node
- **Optimistic Writes**: Local apply with background Raft synchronization
- **Strict Consistency**: Optional linearizable reads via leader contact
- Backward compatibility with existing MooseFS clients

### 6. Failure Handling
- Single node crash recovery with zero data loss
- Network partition tolerance with continued operation
- Datacenter loss survival with multi-region placement
- Automatic conflict resolution via CRDT semantics

### 7. Operational Tools
- Bootstrap commands for initial cluster setup
- Runtime shard migration and rebalancing
- Monitoring and observability dashboards
- Leader transfer and maintenance operations

## Performance Requirements

### Latency Targets
- Local writes (same DC): 1-3ms (50th percentile), 10ms (99th percentile)
- Remote writes (cross-DC): 8-25ms (50th percentile), 60ms (99th percentile)
- Reads (any node): 0.3ms (50th percentile), 2ms (99th percentile)

### Scalability Targets
- Support 1000+ metadata operations per second per shard
- Handle 100+ concurrent shards
- Scale to petabyte-scale filesystems
- Support multi-region deployments

## Security Requirements

### Authentication and Authorization
- Reuse existing MooseFS TLS mutual authentication
- Implement per-shard Raft group secrets with rotation
- AES-GCM encryption for ring delta messages
- Support for existing MooseFS access control mechanisms
