# MooseFS High Availability and Metadata Sharding - Progress Report

## Project Overview
This project implements a complete high-availability (HA) and metadata sharding solution for MooseFS Community Edition. The design focuses on the metadata tier while keeping the existing chunkserver layer untouched.

## Current Status
- **Project Phase**: Phase 0 - Foundation
- **Tasks Complete**: 0/25 (0%)
- **Current Focus**: Project initialization and planning

## Key Accomplishments
- ✅ TaskMaster project initialized
- ✅ Comprehensive PRD document created
- ✅ Initial task breakdown completed (25 tasks)
- ✅ Development environment documentation updated (CLAUDE.md)

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 0 tasks starting with development environment setup
2. Analyze existing MooseFS codebase architecture
3. Plan the refactoring of mfsmetalogger components

## Technical Architecture Summary
- **Raft Leader Lock Pattern**: Per-shard leadership with fast failover
- **CRDT-based Metadata**: Multi-writer capability with eventual consistency
- **Circular Replication Ring**: Efficient delta propagation
- **Sharding Strategy**: Blake3 hash-based consistent shard assignment

## Performance Targets
- Local writes: 1-3ms (50th percentile)
- Remote writes: 8-25ms (50th percentile) 
- Reads: 0.3ms (50th percentile)
- Zero-RPO/sub-second RTO for metadata operations

## Implementation Phases
- **Phase 0** (Foundation): Environment setup, refactoring
- **Phase 1** (Basic HA): Raft integration, leader election
- **Phase 2** (CRDT Integration): Circular replication, optimistic writes
- **Phase 3** (Sharding): Shard table, rebalancing, cross-shard ops
- **Phase 4** (Production): Documentation, tooling, optimization

## Recent Activity
- Project initialized with TaskMaster MCP
- Comprehensive PRD document created based on detailed technical specification
- 25 initial tasks generated with proper dependencies
- Development guidelines established in CLAUDE.md

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Complexity**: Using proven libraries (etcd-raft/Hashicorp Raft)
- **Performance**: Continuous benchmarking planned
- **Community adoption**: Extensive documentation and training materials planned
